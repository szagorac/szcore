--- Both server and test on localhost

-- http request only
Each client sends http requests for initial html/js/css/mp3, overall size 1.95MB
Staggered client requests,
Random number of clients between 1 and 5 starts at the same time
Next client request batch happens at random time between 0 and 1000ms 

Number of clients: 200, test duration ~ 50 sec
